	<p>Creating has always been an important aspect of my life. Whether it is writing poetry, short stories, or trying to create
		music. I did theater all growing up and it was amazing to create characters. At the time I thought that was a personal endeavor.
		I have come to find that Web Development brings with it a new type of creation and it is just as meaningful as any art form.
		I am still growing as a developer but each day brings new tools, new ideas, new perpectives that will ultimately lend itself
		to my work. That's pretty cool if you ask me. To be constantly learning and applying it to your life and work. </p>
		
		<p> I am originally from Texas and have lived in Utah for about 4 years. I am half Puerto Rican but fully love Puerto
		Rico. I am play soccer whenever I can, I play with my Golden Doodle whenever I can. Please send me a message or email if
		you need help with a project or would like to get in touch with me.</p>
